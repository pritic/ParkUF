# ParkUF
ParkUF is an Android app that lets the users know of the availability and corresponding decal requirement of parking slots in various parking lots within the University of Florida campus

This repository contains the front-end code that real-time information about the slots. This information can be derived from any database and sensor system (I used MongoDB with Node.js and Express framework on Amazon Web Services EC2 platform which was further integrated with sensor output using Arduino)

The .apk file can be downloaded from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzt413us3qdu3mk/parkUF.apk?dl=0
